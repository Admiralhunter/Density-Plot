# Density-Plot

This python script will create a 2D density plot by using a gaussian KDE. This was used to create a visual representation of the probability of the checker landing in a specific location for each week. This allowed the group to present to the professor how in control of apparatus was for our Six Sigma Project.

The Heat Maps folder contains the graphs used to present my groups data at my Six Sigma Green Belt presentations. It shows the probability for a checker to land at each grid location for each week and shows that our initial apparatus was bad but each week it improves.

The PDF file is a demonstration of what the project entailed and how we presented our data to our professor.
